**Anna: 19:00**
"Hi Dr. Weber. Thanks for the encrypted chat.
I'm embarrassed to talk about this in person."

**Dr_Weber: 19:05**
"No judgment here, Anna. This is confidential.
What's your concern?"

**Anna: 19:10**
"I think I have an STI. But my partner doesn't know
I've had other partners recently.
We're not exclusive, but... complicated."

**Dr_Weber: 19:15**
"Let's focus on your health first.
What symptoms do you have?"

**Anna: 19:20**
"Vaginal discharge (yellowish), pain during sex,
lower abdominal pain for 3 days.
I'm scared it's serious."

**Dr_Weber: 19:25**
"Could be several things: Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Trichomoniasis.
We need testing. Can you do rapid tests?"

**Anna: 19:30**
"Yes, but discreetly. I don't want my partner to find out
until I know what it is.
We live together."

**Dr_Weber: 19:35**
"I understand. Here's what we do:
1) Order home testing kit (arrives tomorrow, nondescript box)
2) You test at home
3) Results to me encrypted within 48 hours
4) Then we tell partner for contact tracing"

**Anna: 19:40**
"What if it's positive? What happens?"

**Dr_Weber: 19:45**
"Most STIs are easily treatable with antibiotics.
But your partner MUST get tested and treated too.
Plus, you need to notify other recent partners."

**Anna: 19:50**
"Oh God. I have 3 other recent partners.
This is a nightmare.
What if they're angry? What if my partner leaves me?"

**Dr_Weber: 19:55**
"That's a relationship question, not a medical one.
But medically: STIs are common, treatable, no shame.
Legally: You have duty to notify partners to protect their health."

**Anna: 20:00**
"I'm terrified. I made stupid choices.
But I deserve this treatment because of it."

**Dr_Weber: 20:05**
"No shame. But this is outcome of unprotected sex.
Future: Use condoms. PrEP if you're at risk.
Have open conversation with partner about boundaries."

**Anna: 20:10**
"You're right. I need to be honest.
This relationship might be over anyway.
But at least everyone can get treated."

**Dr_Weber: 20:15**
"That's mature thinking.
Order the kit now. Results Monday.
Call me immediately with positive result."

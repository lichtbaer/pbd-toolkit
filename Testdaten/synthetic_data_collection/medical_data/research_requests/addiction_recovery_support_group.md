**Marcus_Recovery: 15:00**
"Hi everyone. I'm Marcus. I have 47 days clean.
But today was HARD. I almost used."

**Sarah_Strong: 15:05**
"Welcome Marcus! What happened today?"

**Marcus_Recovery: 15:10**
"My boss fired me. Wanted to celebrate. Old habit.
I drove to dealer's place, but didn't go in.
Walked around the block 10 times instead."

**David_Clean: 15:15**
"That's AMAZING Marcus! You used your tools!
What kept you from going in?"

**Marcus_Recovery: 15:20**
"I thought of my daughter. She's 6.
I'm custody hearing next week. Court will test me.
If I relapse, I lose her forever."

**Julia_Sponsor: 15:25**
"The fear keeps you clean sometimes. But danger:
Fear can also PUSH you to use (escapism).
Have you talked to your sponsor?"

**Marcus_Recovery: 15:30**
"Yes. Thomas (my sponsor) said: 'You're at a crossroads.'
Two paths: 1) Use tonight, lose custody forever.
2) Call me, go to meeting, stay clean."

**Anna_Therapist: 15:35**
"Marcus, how are you managing the depression?
Are you still taking Sertraline (50mg)?"

**Marcus_Recovery: 15:40**
"Yes, but it's not enough. I also see Dr. Weber (psychiatrist).
She added Bupropion yesterday.
But honestly: The real drug I want is heroin. Just one fix."

**David_Clean: 15:45**
"One fix is a lie. You know that.
One fix = Back to 5 bags/day.
Back to crime. Back to prison.
Is that what you want?"

**Marcus_Recovery: 15:50**
"No! God no.
But the craving is PHYSICAL.
I feel it in my chest, my arms.
My body SCREAMS for it."

**Julia_Sponsor: 15:55**
"That's withdrawal talking. It passes.
In 15 minutes, the craving will peak and drop.
Can you do 15 minutes?"

**Marcus_Recovery: 16:00**
"I'm in the group chat right now.
That's me doing 15 minutes.
Thank you all. Really."

**Sarah_Strong: 16:05**
"You got this Marcus.
47 days is a BIG deal.
Tomorrow you'll have 48 days.
Then 49. Eventually 365."

**Marcus_Recovery: 16:10**
"I'll call Thomas now. Stay safe brothers & sisters.
Thank you for being here."

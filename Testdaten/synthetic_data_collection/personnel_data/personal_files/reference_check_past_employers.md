**Date of Call:** 2024-01-12

**Feedback Summary:** NEGATIVE

### Specific Comments:

"Klaus was technically skilled but had significant interpersonal problems. He was often insubordinate, didn't follow instructions, and clashed with team members.

Most concerning: Near the end of his employment, we discovered he had copied proprietary company code to a personal device. We let him leave quietly to avoid legal costs.

I would NOT recommend him for positions requiring trustworthiness or access to sensitive systems."

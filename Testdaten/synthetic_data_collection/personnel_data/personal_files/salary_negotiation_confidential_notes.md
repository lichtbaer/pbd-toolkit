**Negotiator (Company):** CFO Thomas Weber

---

## Pre-Negotiation Assessment

**Current Salary:** €82,000
**Market Rate:** €90,000-€98,000 for comparable role
**Employee Leverage:** MODERATE (Has 2 other job offers)
**Our Leverage:** WEAK (Need to keep her - Key project in progress)

---

## Strategy

**Our Approach:**
- Start at €84,000 (2% raise - below market)
- Maximum authorized to offer: €92,000
- Don't reveal maximum upfront
- Cite budget constraints

**Anticipated Issues:**
- She will ask for €98,000 (market rate + premium)
- She has competing offers (will leverage these)
- She's been here 7 years (loyalty factor)

## Negotiation Notes (Actual Conversation)

**14:00 - Anna starts:**
"I've received offers from other companies. CompTech is offering €96,000 + equity. BioPharm is €93,000 with bonus structure.

I love working here, but I need to be competitive."

**14:05 - Thomas responds:**
"We value you greatly. But budget is tight this year (project over budget). We can offer €84,000."

**14:10 - Anna reacts:**
"That's insulting. I'm worth more. I need €95,000 minimum."

**14:15 - Thomas negotiates:**
"€95,000 is not possible. That exceeds market for internal roles. We can go to €88,000."

**14:25 - Anna:**
"I have written offers in hand. This is my last offer to stay: €92,000 base + 15% performance bonus."

**14:30 - Thomas (AUTHORIZED UP TO €92,000):**
"OK, we can do €92,000 base. But bonus is only for executive level (she's manager). Counter-offer: €90,000 + 10% performance bonus (capped €9,000)."

**14:40 - Anna accepts:**
"Deal. €90,000 + 10% bonus. I'll stay."

## Outcome

**Final Offer:** €90,000 base + 10% bonus potential
**Approval:** Authorized - CFO Thomas Weber
**Start Date:** 2024-02-01

**Notes for Record:**
- She negotiated well - Got €8,000 more than we initially offered
- She has OTHER job offers (flight risk if conditions worsen)
- Bonus cap is important (she can't exceed 10% without approval)
- Review again in 12 months (likely she'll demand more)

**Recommendation:** Keep her happy. She's key to Project X success.

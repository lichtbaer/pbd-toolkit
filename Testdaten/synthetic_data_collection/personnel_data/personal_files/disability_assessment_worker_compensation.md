# DISABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR WORKER'S COMPENSATION

**Assessment Date:** 2024-01-20
**Evaluating Physician:** Dr. Klaus Mueller (Occupational Medicine)
**Patient:** Anna Weber
**Case Number:** WC-2024-0156

---

## Referral Information

**Referred by:** Workers' Compensation Insurance (Berufsgenossenschaft)
**Reason:** Assessment of work capacity after workplace injury

**Injury:** Chemical burn (hydrofluoric acid exposure) - 2023-06-15
**Time since injury:** 7 months

---

## Injury Details

**Incident:** Accidental chemical spill in laboratory
**Chemical:** Hydrofluoric acid (HF)
**Exposure:** Right hand and forearm (second-degree burns, 15% body surface area)
**Immediate treatment:** Emergency care, hospitalization 3 weeks
**Acute phase:** Surgery x2 (skin grafts, scar revision)

---

## Current Physical Examination

**Right hand:**
- Extensive scarring (estimated 40% of dorsal surface)
- Decreased range of motion (ROM):
  - Finger extension: 50% of normal
  - Grip strength: 25% of pre-injury (damaged median nerve)
  - Fine motor control: POOR (picking up small objects difficult)
- Chronic pain: 6-7/10 (constant, worsened by activity)
- Neuropathy: Permanent nerve damage (HF acid injury)

**Neurological findings:**
- Median nerve injury (confirmed by EMG)
- Partial nerve regeneration but incomplete recovery likely
- Nerve pain ("neuropathic pain") - ongoing

**Functional impact:**
- Cannot perform fine motor tasks (writing, typing difficult)
- Grip strength insufficient for many jobs
- Pain limits usage (cannot sustain activity >15-20 min)

---

## Occupational History

**Pre-injury occupation:** Laboratory technician
**Job duties:** Chemistry analysis, microscopy, documentation

**Post-injury capacity:**
- Cannot return to pre-injury role (requires fine motor tasks)
- Cannot perform tasks requiring sustained gripping
- Pain management limits capacity for activities

---

## Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE)

**Light work capacity:**
- Sitting tolerance: 4-5 hours/day (limited by pain)
- Standing: 2-3 hours/day
- Pushing/pulling: 5-10 lbs max (vs. 50 lbs pre-injury)
- Grasping/pinching: SEVERELY LIMITED
- Fine motor control: POOR (cannot type for sustained periods)

**Modified duty recommendations:**
- Light clerical work (if typing not required)
- Customer service (phone-based)
- Supervisory/administrative roles (non-manual)
- Teaching/training (minimal manual component)

---

## Impairment Rating

**Permanent partial impairment:** 35%
(Based on AMA Guides to Evaluation of Permanent Impairment)

**Calculation:**
- Upper extremity impairment: 60%
- Hand impairment: 40% (of upper extremity)
- Overall rating: 60% x 40% x 35% body weighting = 35% PPD

---

## Disability Status Determination

**Work capacity:** PARTIALLY DISABLED

**Recommendation:** 
- Patient CAN work in modified/light duty role
- Cannot return to pre-injury occupation
- Estimated earning capacity: 60-70% of pre-injury wages

**Vocational rehabilitation:**
- Eligible for retraining program
- Recommended: Transition to administrative/supervisory role
- Timeline: 6-12 months retraining

---

## Psychological Impact

**Reported mood:** Depressive symptoms related to disability
**Self-perception:** "I feel useless - can't do my job"
**Counseling:** Recommended (emotional adjustment to disability)

---

## Prognosis

**Short-term:** Some pain improvement likely (neuropathy may take years to stabilize)
**Long-term:** Permanent partial impairment - full recovery unlikely
**Complications:** Chronic pain syndrome possible (risk of opioid dependency)

---

## Worker's Compensation Determination

**Disability classification:** PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY (35%)

**Recommended benefits:**
- Permanent partial disability award: €35,000 (€100K × 35%)
- Vocational rehabilitation: Covered
- Medical care: Continue as needed
- Return-to-work accommodation: Required

**Estimated earning loss:** 30-40% ongoing
**Future healthcare:** Ongoing treatment expected

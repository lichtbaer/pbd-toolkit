What is the nature of the violation?"

Patients could die. The drug (PharmaDose-XR) has serious side effects
that we covered up."

Patient names? Trial data?"

- 23 serious adverse events NOT reported
- 4 deaths classified as 'unrelated'

"Dr. Marcus Weber (Chief Medical Officer) ordered falsification.
CFO Thomas Fischer approved budget for CRO fraud.
CEO Klaus Hoffmann knew but looked away.
Emails prove it - I have copies."

You need legal representation. Lawyer privilege protected.
I'm connecting you with Attorney Maria Schmidt (whistleblower specialist)."

Everything you say is protected attorney-client privilege.
Tell me the full story."

"This is Qui Tam case material (False Claims Act).
Potential penalties: €300M+ for defrauding FDA/EMA.
You could receive 15-30% of recovered amount (whistleblower share).
But risk: Retaliation, prosecution for theft of documents?"

**Anonymous_Whistleblower: 15:20**
"I don't want money. People are dying.
But I need protection for my family.
They will fire me when this comes out."

**Attorney_Schmidt: 15:25**

Then we go public if DOJ doesn't investigate within 60 days.
Retaliation protection: Whistleblower Protection Act.
Let's meet in person tomorrow. Encrypted video. Use TOR."

Our due diligence found:\n- Real EBITDA: €4.2M (not €6.8M claimed)\n- €12M undisclosed debt\n- Key customer leaving (€2M revenue)\n- Environmental violations (€8M liability)\n\nWe need to negotiate down to €18M immediately. The seller is desperate - they have debt issues.\n\nKeep this quiet. If market finds out, they'll abandon the deal OR demand higher price from us.\n\nKlaus"

      "body": "Klaus, Thomas,\n\nI have legal concerns about our approach:\n\n1. If we use non-public due diligence information to lower the offer, that could be construed as fraud\n2. If we conceal material information from the seller, that's misrepresentation\n3. Document retention: All communications must be preserved (regulatory requirement)\n\nRecommendation: Use information transparently in negotiation. Frame as: \"Due diligence revealed issues that reduce valuation.\"\n\nThis is legally defensible and ethical.\n\nAnna"

      "body": "Anna,\n\nI hear you. But business isn't always clean. Every deal involves information asymmetry.\n\nLet's just say: \"Preliminary findings require valuation adjustment.\"\n\nThat's technically true but not fully transparent about what we found. If they want more details, they can hire their own consultant.\n\nThis saves us €10M+. I have shareholder duty to get best price.\n\nKlaus"

The SEC/BaFin could investigate this later.\n\nIf we're being dishonest now, and it gets discovered:\n- Criminal charges for securities fraud\n- €50M+ penalties\n- Jail time\n- Company reputation destroyed\n\nThe €10M savings isn't worth the risk.\n\nLet's do this right: Full transparency + fair negotiation.\n\nThomas"

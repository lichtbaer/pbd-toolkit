**Ahmad: 10:00**
"Assalamu Alaykum brothers & sisters.
I finally received my Duldung (tolerated status) yesterday.
But it's NOT asylum approval."

**Leila: 10:05**
"Congratulations Ahmad! This is step 1.
How long can you stay now?"

**Ahmad: 10:10**
"6 months renewable. But no work permission yet.
My wife is 7 months pregnant.
How will we survive without income?"

**Fatima_Organizer: 10:15**
"You have RIGHT to social support (Sozialleistung).
€450/month per person. We help with application.
But first question: Are you registered with Ausländerbehörde?"

**Ahmad: 10:20**
"Yes. Registered as Syrian national, born Damascus 1987.
Passport number: XXXX-XXX-XXX (old Syrian document, expires 2025).
But I'm afraid..."

**Fatima: 10:25**
"Of what?"

**Ahmad: 10:30**
"My family is still in Damascus. If I'm registered,
Syrian government might know I'm here.
They might retaliate against my wife's parents."

**Hassan: 10:35**
"This is real risk. Syria has spy networks in Europe.
Many of us have had family threatened after registration."

**Lawyer_Ibrahim: 10:40**
"I'm here as legal advisor. Here's your rights:
1) You can apply for asylum WITHOUT revealing family
2) Family location is CONFIDENTIAL (even from German govt)
3) But you MUST register for social benefits
4) Risk: Extremely LOW if you don't publicize"

**Ahmad: 10:45**
"My wife wants to go back to Syria soon.
I told her no! It's not safe.
But her mother is alone in Homs."

**Leila: 10:50**
"Syria is still dangerous. Please tell her:
- 500K+ killed in civil war
- Torture still common
- No real freedom
- Your child will be born in safety here"

**Fatima: 10:55**
"Ahmad, have you experienced torture?
This affects asylum application..."

**Ahmad: 11:00**
"I don't want to talk about it.
Too painful. But yes... I was detained.
They tortured me for 3 weeks (2021).
After, I escaped to Turkey then EU."

**Lawyer_Ibrahim: 11:05**
"This is STRONG asylum basis!
You should apply immediately, not just Duldung.
Torture + political persecution = Almost guaranteed approval."

**Ahmad: 11:10**
"But they would need documentation...
I have no proof. Just scars.
And psychological trauma (PTSD, nightmares, insomnia)."

**Hassan: 11:15**
"Medical report helps. Trauma specialists can testify.
Have you seen German psychologist?"

**Ahmad: 11:20**
"I can't afford it. €80 per session.
I have €12 in bank account right now."

**Fatima: 11:25**
"FREE trauma counseling available through NGO!
I'll send you contact. You MUST tell them about torture.
This strengthens your asylum case significantly."
